# SecureDNS.eu Config

SecureDNS has been decomissioned as of 30/04/2020. This means I won't do any merges in regards to the configuration. I am also aware that there might be a better configuration.

- DNS plain: bind9/named (https://isc.org)
- DNS over HTTPS: doh-server (https://github.com/m13253/dns-over-https)
- DNS over TLS: haproxy (https://haproxy.org)
